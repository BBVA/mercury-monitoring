***mercury-monitoring*** is a library to monitor data and model drift. 

## Mercury project at BBVA

Mercury is a collaborative library that was developed by the Advanced Analytics community at BBVA. Originally, it was created as an [InnerSource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_source) project but after some time, we decided to release certain parts of the project as Open Source.
That's the case with the `mercury-monitoring` package. 

If you're interested in learning more about the Mercury project, we recommend reading this blog [post](https://www.bbvaaifactory.com/mercury-acelerando-la-reutilizacion-en-ciencia-de-datos-dentro-de-bbva/) from www.bbvaaifactory.com

## User installation

The easiest way to install `mercury-monitoring` is using ``pip``:

    pip install -U mercury-monitoring

## Help and support 

This library is currently maintained by a dedicated team of data scientists and machine learning engineers from BBVA AI Factory.
